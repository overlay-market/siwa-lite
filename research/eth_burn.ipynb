    "Conclusions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ADF test shows that the data is stationary. However, the ADF test is designed to test for a unit root, which is a specific form of non-stationarity. When the ADF test indicates that the time series is stationary, it means that there is no unit root according to the test's criteria. However, this does not necessarily mean that the series has no other forms of non-stationarity, such as seasonality or changing variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The ACF plot shows a wave like pattern with a period of ~48. Since the data is sampled every 30 mins, this means that there is a daily seaoanlity in the data. This comes across in the decomposition plot as well."
